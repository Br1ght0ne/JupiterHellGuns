# Jupiter Hell Guns - a CoQ weapon mod

[Steam Workshop]

This mod adds some guns inspired by unique/exotic ones in [Jupiter Hell] to [Caves of Qud].

Disclaimer: no 100% similarity. I tried to make the guns feel the same way as in JH, but that's hard. Balance changes are definitely needed.

## Currently implemented

- 9mm calibrated (high penetration, moderate accuracy, low damage)
- .44 deagle (high damage and accuracy, moderate penetration)
- Love (magazine pistol, heal on hit)
- Death (energy pistol, stacking damage debuff)
- Bloodletter (rifle, reload using either blood or health)
- CRI EMP rifle (applies EMP on hit)
